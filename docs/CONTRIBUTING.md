# Contributing

## Contribute to freqtrade

Feel like our bot is missing a feature? We welcome your pull requests! 

Issues labeled good first issue can be good first contributions, and will help get you familiar with the codebase.

Few pointers for contributions:

- Create your PR against the `develop` branch, not `main`.
- New features need to contain unit tests and should be documented with the introduction PR.
- PR's can be declared as `[WIP]` - which signify Work in Progress Pull Requests (which are not finished).

If you are unsure, discuss the feature in an issue before a Pull Request.

## Getting started

Best start by reading the [documentation](https://www.freqtrade.io/) which should help you getting started.

## Before sending the PR

### 1. Run unit tests

All unit tests must pass. If a unit test is broken, change your code to 
make it pass. It means you have introduced a regression.

#### Test the whole project

```bash
go test -v -cover -coverprofile=cover.out `go list ./...`
```
## Committer Guide

Ensure that each pull request meets all requirements in the Contributing document.

### Issues

If an issue is a bug that needs an urgent fix, mark it for the next patch release.
Then either fix it or mark as please-help.

For other issues: encourage friendly discussion, moderate debate, offer your thoughts.

### Your own code changes

All code changes, regardless of who does them, need to be reviewed and merged by someone else.
This rule applies to all the core committers.

Exceptions:

- Minor corrections and fixes to pull requests submitted by others.
- While making a formal release, the release manager can make necessary, appropriate changes.
- Small documentation changes that reinforce existing subject matter. Most commonly being, but not limited to spelling and grammar corrections.
